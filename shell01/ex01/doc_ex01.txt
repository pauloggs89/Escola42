sed - stream editor for filtering and transforming text
	Sed  is  a  stream  editor.  A stream editor is used to perform basic text transformations on an input stream (a file or input from a pipeline).  While in some ways
	similar to an editor which permits scripted edits (such as ed), sed works by making only one pass over the input(s), and is consequently more efficient.  But it  is
	sed's ability to filter text in a pipeline which particularly distinguishes it from other types of editors.

s/regexp/replacement/
    Attempt  to  match  regexp against the pattern space.  If successful, replace that portion matched with replacement.  The replacement may contain the special
    character & to refer to that portion of the pattern space which matched, and the special escapes \1 through \9 to refer to the corresponding matching sub-ex‚Äê
	pressions in the regexp.
ex: 'substitute/what.to.replace /what.replace.with/global'
