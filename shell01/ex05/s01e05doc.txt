3.1.2.1 Escape Character
A non-quoted backslash ‘\’ is the Bash escape character. It preserves the literal value of the next character that follows, with the exception 
of newline. If a \newline pair appears, and the backslash itself is not quoted, the \newline is treated as a line continuation (that is, it is 
removed from the input stream and effectively ignored).
