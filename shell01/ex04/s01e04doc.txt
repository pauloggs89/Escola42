answer: ifconfig | grep 'ether' | sed "s/'*ether'//g"

1st step:
ifconfig - configure a network interface
| - Pipes let you use the output of a program as the input of another one

2nd step: filter the output to get only the ether information.
grep - searches for PATTERNS in each FILE.  
ether - PATTERNS is one or patterns separated by newline characters, and grep prints each line that matches a pattern.

3rd step: remove the word 'ehter' from output.
sed - stream editor for filtering and transforming text
	Sed  is  a  stream  editor.  A stream editor is used to perform basic text transformations on an input stream (a file or input from a pipeline).  While in some ways
	similar to an editor which permits scripted edits (such as ed), sed works by making only one pass over the input(s), and is consequently more efficient.  But it  is
	sed's ability to filter text in a pipeline which particularly distinguishes it from other types of editors.
"s/ether//g" <- "s/regexp/replacement/"
    Attempt  to  match  regexp against the pattern space.  If successful, replace that portion matched with replacement.  The replacement may contain the special
    character & to refer to that portion of the pattern space which matched, and the special escapes \1 through \9 to refer to the corresponding matching sub-ex‐
	pressions in the regexp.

4th step:bash remove whitespace from the output beginning.
sed "s/^[[:space:]]*//g" <- sed troca os espaços brancos do início por nada, removendo os espaços brancos.

5th step: changed permission to execute with ./MAC.sh | cat -e
code: chmod 755 MAC.sh

expected output:
>$ ./MAC.sh | cat -e
f2:5b:44:60:f5:aa txqueuelen 1000 (Ethernet)$
8a:ec:c7:ac:30:81 txqueuelen 1000 (Ethernet)$
ca:17:6b:da:36:fc txqueuelen 1000 (Ethernet)$
02:42:0a:02:03:0a txqueuelen 0 (Ethernet)$
